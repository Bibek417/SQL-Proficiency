## Let's First Learn About RDBMS

- **rdbms** stands for Relational Database Management System. It helps to store our data while preserving the relationships within the data.
- It is a database management system that stores data in the form of tables, where each table is related to other tables in the database. Due to this relationship, it is called a Relational Database Management System.
- There are many types of RDBMS such as MS SQL, MySQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, Amazon Aurora, SAP HANA, IBM Informix, MariaDB, etc. Mostly, the first three are commonly used.

## Now Let's Learn SQL

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: It is a language that helps us communicate with an RDBMS.
- SQL is also referred to as a "Domain-Specific Language," meaning it is more user-friendly and not as programmatic, similar to how we communicate in simple English.
- With the help of SQL, we can create, manipulate, delete, and share data in a relational manner.
